## Introduction
This application was built as a take home challenge and utilizes the NYT [Top Stories API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview). Developers were given an 8-hour time frame to meet an MVP, but all other decisions were to be made by them.

The project spec can be found [here](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe), and the rubric can be found [here](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_rubric).

  - A strong understanding of React JS , React Hooks, and Front-End best practices
  - Ability to prioritize an MVP

## Possible Future Extensions
